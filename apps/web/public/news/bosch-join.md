I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Senior Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bosch-global-software-technologies/mycompany/">Bosch Global Software Technologies</a>!

It has been a long ride road up to this point, but I am not patting myself on the back just yet. A lot to learn and a lot to experience.
