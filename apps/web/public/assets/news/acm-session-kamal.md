I had the honor of leading a session titled <b>"Moving from notebooks to py files for machine learning projects"</b> for the [ACM IITH Student chapter](https://iith.acm.org/). The session aimed to provide insights and guidance for fellow students looking to excel in their machine learning projects. I am grateful to the ACM IITH Student chapter for giving me this opportunity, and to all the attendees for their participation and insightful discussion. I hope the session was helpful to everyone who attended.
