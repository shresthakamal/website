Wow, three Bravo Awards in less than a year at Bosch! I'm truly honored and grateful for this recognition.
<br><br>
A huge thanks to my amazing lead for the kind words. It's been a fantastic journey diving into long document classification and gaining expertise in RAG and LLMs. Sharing this knowledge with the cluster and presenting at forums has been a rewarding experience.
<br>


I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the RAI team and the NLP cluster for their constant support and encouragement. You all make it a joy to come to work every day.
<br>

Hereâ€™s to continuing this exciting journey together and striving for excellence!
