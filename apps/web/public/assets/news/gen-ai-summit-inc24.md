I feel honoured to have been a part of such impactful event for invite only professionals in the GENAI space in India. 

The summit featured over 45 speakers across 15 sessions and 300+ delegates, offering a full-day immersive experience, ensuring significant value and exclusive networking opportunities for everyone. The event focused on the applications of Generative AI in the Indian Market.

Had a great time networking will all the founders, CEOs, startups, VCs and all professionals.

Special acknowledgement of the CR team at BOSCH Global Software Technology, Kormangala, Bangalore for their constatnt support and encouragement.

Still a long way for me to go and a lot to learn. 


Looking forward to attending many such summits and conferences in the coming days.
