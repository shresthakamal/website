# ðŸŒŸ A Heartfelt Goodbye and a New Beginning ðŸŒŸ  
<img width="1100px"  src="/assets/img/bosch/3.jpeg">


This important moment marks the end of my incredible journey at **Bosch Global Software Technologies** as an **MLE**.  
It has definitely not been easy to say goodbye to the place where I have grown so muchâ€”both professionally and personallyâ€”**especially fresh out of the farm**.  

###### **Thank you for believing in me.**  

My sincerest gratitude and special thanks to the entire **CR/RAI - NLP team** here at **BOSCH**, including Sundeep P. ([Head of Applied AI @ Bosch Research](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sundeep-p-a93b7415/)), Kartheek Palepu ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartheekpalepu/)), Divyansh Tomar ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyansh-tomar/)), Jahnavi Chandra, Santhosh Boddana, Abhik Debnath, Sangeeth S. Nambiar, Sudesh Mirashi, Avinash Kumar, Harshita, Shilpa, and the entire **RAI Team**, for their valuable guidance, support, and encouragement in every step along the way. ðŸ’¡  
It truly breaks my heart to have had so few opportunities to collaborate with such a **passionate and talented team**.

###### **To my incredible colleagues:**  
I am profoundly grateful for the amazing experiences and, most importantly, the **lifelong friendships and mentorships** I have gained along this journey.  

As I look forward to new opportunities, I feel a mix of emotionsâ€”**anxious yet hopeful**â€”but most of all, **determined to do good**. Iâ€™m excited to embrace the possibilities ahead, take on new challenges, explore uncharted territories, and make an impact.  

Hereâ€™s to **growth, gratitude, and new beginnings**. ðŸš€

Thank you once again,<br>
